## Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow

This repository is all about the interpretation of each chapter of the book combined with the exercises done, as well.

The goal of this repository is to share the knowledge gained throughout the book including the done exercises that, with high hopes, will initiate the discussions from other amateurs and professionals in Machine Learning fields. I will be more than grateful in advance for any insight, discussions and critics that we can have in the future.

With solutions to exercises included per chapter, I will also share some mini projects that use the techniques discussed by the authors of this book. All projects and codes will be, initially, done in Jupyter Notebooks and combine the other techniques from other books. If I decide to build an application that uses machine learning and techniques, I will share it in other repository and links will be included here.

I'd like to note that I will share the links of my personal interpretation and solutions from research papers I read as I go along with this book.

Note that, alongside with this book, I will also rely on other machine learning and deep learning sources, like the book **Deep Learning** by Ian Goodfellow for more in-depth explanation of mini projects that use deep learning solutions in more rigorous way.

If you wish to contact me for anything related to Machine Learning and Deep Learning, please do not hesitate to, I am more than open to build the networks with anyone interested in the said fields.


With kind regards,

Said SalihefendiÄ‡
